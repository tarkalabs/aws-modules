# AWS Modules

Welcome to `aws-modules`, a collection of Terraform and Terragrunt modules designed

## Example: ServerlessForms Full Stack Setup

To demonstrate how to use these modules, we've provided a full-stack example for 
setting up ServerlessForms on AWS using ECS in the examples directory. This 
example showcases how to configure a complete infrastructure using the modules 
described above.

We hope you find these modules helpful in streamlining your AWS 
infrastructure deployment. Happy coding! ðŸš€
